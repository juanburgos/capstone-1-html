    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>Most of my interests dwell in creative engagement.</p>

      <h2><li>Music</li></h2>
      <p>
        It's hard to say that I have a favorite kind of music or a favorite band
        or artist. There's music for every moment, activity or sentiment. As a
        musician, I like to explore every genre of music.
      </p>
      <p>
        This does not mean that I will like everything that I listen to by
        default. Still, I will use judgement to determine if whatever I am
        listening to is worth my time and effort.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, I look for the quality of the production. I'll pay
        attention to the instrumentation and musicianship, harmonies, lyrics,
        recording quality, album art, and originality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not trying to sound anything like snobby here. But I want you to maybe
        give me the benefit-of-doubt that I just pay close attention to good
        quality, and that is what I prefer to consume.
      </p>
      <p>
        But if you need something more specific, just so you can have a rough
        idea I like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rock</li>
        <li>Pop</li>
        <li>Jazz</li>
        <li>Blues</li>
        <li>Hip Hop</li>
        <li>Country</li>
        <li>Bluegrass</li>
        <li>Dance</li>
        <li>Salsa</li>
        <li>Merengue</li>
        <li>Classical</li>
        <li>And more...</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Instruments</h3>
      <p>
        I also was a professional musician back in the day before the Great
        Recession. Where I earned a living playing mostly top 40s and Latin hits
        in Puerto Rico.
      </p>
      <p>The instruments that I play are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bass Guitar</li>
        <li>Double Bass</li>
        <li>Guitar</li>
        <li>Piano</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I'm also into effect pedals and have my own pedalboard and collection of
        al sorts of effects for bass.
      </p>
      <h2><li>Gastronomy</li></h2>
      <p>
        Gastronomy is a very important part in my life. I have loved cooking and
        watching culinary TV shows since I was a child.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2011 I received my Associate's Degree in Culinary Arts and worked in
        various restaurants and cafeterias. What I experienced, made me realise
        how important it is to cook at home.
